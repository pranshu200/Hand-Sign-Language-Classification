# Hand-Sign-Language-Classification
Objective: The project aims at building a machine learning model that will be able to classify the various hand gestures used for fingerspelling in sign language. In this model, classification machine learning algorithms are trained using a set of image data.

#Dataset
The "ASL Alphabet Dataset" was taken from Kaggle and used to train the model.
